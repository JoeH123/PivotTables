\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{pivot-table-components}{%
\section{Pivot Table Components}\label{pivot-table-components}}

The components of a pivot table are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Rows:} The row field(s) determine the arrangement of data in the rows of the pivot table. Each unique value in the row field(s) creates a separate row in the pivot table, and the data is organized accordingly.
\item
  \textbf{Columns:} The column field(s) determine the arrangement of data in the columns of the pivot table. Similar to the row field(s), each unique value in the column field(s) creates a separate column in the pivot table.
\item
  \textbf{Values:} The value field(s) contain the data that is summarized and displayed within the pivot table. These values are typically numeric or measurable data, such as sales figures, quantities, or percentages. The aggregation function applied to the value field(s) determines how the data is summarized (e.g., sum, average, count).
\item
  \textbf{Report Filters:} Report filters allow users to filter the data displayed in the pivot table based on specific criteria. By selecting or deselecting filter options, users can focus on specific subsets of data, making it easier to analyze and draw insights.
\end{itemize}

In summary, the row and column fields determine the structure of the pivot table, the value field(s) contain the data to be summarized, and the report filters allow for further data filtering and analysis. Together, these components provide a flexible and interactive way to explore and analyze complex datasets.
